# Django CRM

A simple Customer Relationship Management (CRM) web application built with Django.  
The project includes authentication, CRUD operations for customer records, and a clean interface.  

The system allows users to **register, log in, and manage customer records** in a secure environment. Authenticated users can add new records, update existing records, delete them, or view details of individual records.  
The project also integrates Djangoâ€™s built-in authentication system with flash messages to provide user feedback during operations (such as successful login, logout, record updates, or errors).
